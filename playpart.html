    <p>KNUT BROVIK.

      [Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
      laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
      much longer!
      
      KAIA.
      
      [Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
      Uncle?
      
      
      BROVIK.
      
      Oh, I seem to get worse every day.
      
      
      RAGNAR.
      
      [Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
      little sleep--
      
      
      BROVIK.
      
      [Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?
      
      
      KAIA.
      
      Then take a little walk.
      
      
      RAGNAR.
      
      Yes, do. I will come with you.
      
      
      BROVIK.
      
      [With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
      it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
      him--with the chief.
      
      
      KAIA.
      
      [Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!
      
      
      RAGNAR.
      
      Yes, better wait, father!
      
      
      BROVIK.
      
      [Draws is breath laboriously.] Ha--ha--! _I_ haven't much time for
      waiting.
      
      
      KAIA.
      
      [Listening.] Hush! I hear him on the stairs.
      
           [All three go back to their work.  A short silence.
      
      
        HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
        longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
        hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
        greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
        broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
        and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.
      
      
      SOLNESS.
      
      [Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
      whisper:] Are they gone?</p>
