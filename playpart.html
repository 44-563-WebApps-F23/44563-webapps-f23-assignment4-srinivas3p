    <p><strong>KNUT BROVIK.</strong></p>

    <p>[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it much longer!</p>

    <p><strong>KAIA.</strong></p>

    <p>[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not, Uncle?</p>

    <p><strong>BROVIK.</strong></p>

    <p>Oh, I seem to get worse every day.</p>

    <p><strong>RAGNAR.</strong></p>

    <p>[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a little sleep--</p>

    <p><strong>BROVIK.</strong></p>

    <p>[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?</p>

    <p><strong>KAIA.</strong></p>

    <p>Then take a little walk.</p>

    <p><strong>RAGNAR.</strong></p>

    <p>Yes, do. I will come with you.</p>

    <p><strong>BROVIK.</strong></p>

    <p>[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I am determined to have it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with him--with the chief.</p>
