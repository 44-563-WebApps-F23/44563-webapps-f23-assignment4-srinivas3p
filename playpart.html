<p class="play-name">BROVIK.</p>

<p>The people are safe enough. <span class="character-name">Ragnar</span> knows them. He is a friend of the family.</p>

<p class="character-name">SOLNESS.</p>

<p>Oh, safe--safe enough! That is not at all what I mean. Good lord--don't you understand me either? <span class="direction">[Angrily.]</span> I won't have anything to do with these strangers. They may apply to whom they please, so far as I am concerned.</p>

<p class="character-name">BROVIK.</p>

<p><span class="direction">[Rising.]</span> Do you really mean that?</p>

<p class="character-name">SOLNESS.</p>

<p><span class="direction">[Sulkily.]</span> Yes I do.--For once in a way. <span class="direction">[He comes forward.</span></p>

<p><span class="direction">[BROVIK exchanges a glance with RAGNAR, who makes a warning gesture. Then BROVIK comes into the front room.</span></p>

<p class="character-name">BROVIK.</p>

<p>May I have a few words with you?</p>

<p class="character-name">SOLNESS.</p>

<p>Certainly.</p>

<p class="character-name">BROVIK.</p>

<p><span class="direction">[To KAIA.]</span> Just go in there for a moment, Kaia.</p>

<p class="character-name">KAIA.</p>

<p><span class="direction">[Uneasily.]</span> Oh, but uncle--</p>

<p class="character-name">BROVIK.</p>

<p>Do as I say, child. And shut the door after you.</p>

<p><span class="direction">[KAIA goes reluctantly into the draughtsmen's office, glances anxiously and imploringly at SOLNESS, and shuts the door.</span></p>
